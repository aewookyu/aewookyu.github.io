# Chapter 4: Paying Respect

When a bride was to meet her in-laws, it was a matter of hiding one’s thoughts. Before entering the city, I had already dressed up in the inn. 

My **Yi Zumu**, Empress Dowager Liu, treated me very well. Before she passed away, she personally conferred my dowry. All the jewellery was from the Palace. I did not use any gold or pearl hair ornaments as they were too eye-catching. One should not show off too much and should not be too simple. Instead, one must show one’s family influence in a low profile manner. 

I chose a hawksbill turtle comb ornament with an exquisite carving of flowers, phoenixes and birds, which one can tell that it was not a common product. One must also put a lot of thought into the clothes that one was wearing.  It was a brocade from a few years back. Even though the colour was not eye-catching, it was a rare material in this chaotic period.

Wei Tan and I got married during the course of the expedition. Now that I was here in the Prime Minister Residence, this will be the first time the elders saw the bride. 

The hall was filled with people, be it men, women, young or old. It seemed like other than the males that were on the expedition, the rest of the Wei Clan that was in Yongdu was all present. As soon as I entered the door, all sorts of gazes landed on me from all directions. There seemed to be a moment of silence, where a pin drop could be heard. 

With my back that was as straight as a ramrod, I took on the most dignified manner, lowered my eyes, and stepped forward after collecting myself. 

“Furen, **Shao Furen**<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="少夫人 - Young Madam; wife of the family's young master"></sup> Fu **Shi**<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="氏(shi) - lit. Clan. After marriage, this word is used to denote her maternal family/clan"></sup> pays her respect.” Zhang **Shi**, who led the way, bowed respectfully. 

“**Shao Furen**, do come forward.” A voice said slowly.

I slightly lifted my eyes and saw a woman sitting on a higher ground, and silently thought that it was probably the *matriarch*<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="主母(zhumu); the wife of the leader of a household/clan"></sup> of the Wei Family, Guo Furen. 

I had a rough understanding of the Wei Family’s situation. Wei Tan’s biological mother, Wu Furen, was Wei Jue’s *first wife*<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="元配(Yuán pèi) - first official wife"></sup>. While Guo Furen was originally Wei Jue’s concubine. Although she came from a poor and humble family, she was Wei Jue’s favourite. Six to seven years ago, Wu Furen died due to an illness, and Guo Furen became JiShi<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="继室 - second wife(taken after the death of a man's first wife)"></sup>, thus becoming my current mother-in-law. 

The embroidered mat was already spread in front of me (to bow). I folded my hand together at my front as I bowed towards her: “**Er Fu**<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote=")lit. this daughter-in-law"></sup>, Fu Shi, pays respect to GuShi<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="mother-in-law"></sup>.”

Guo Furen said with a smile on her voice, “**Shao Furen** must be exhausted after the long journey, quickly get up.”

Zhang **Shi** came over and helped me get up and unsurprisingly, my gaze met with Guo Furen’s measuring gaze. 

She was neither old nor young, and seemed to be in her prime years. It could be seen that she attached great importance to this meeting as her clothes were starched until creases were not seen. Her dark black hair was combed into a heavy and towering bun, but there were not many accessories. The powder on her face and the carefully drawn eyebrows made it difficult to see her expression. 

“One heard that there are frequent rains in the East. One wonders if the journey was smooth?” Guo Furen pulled my hand over and asked in a harmonious voice. 

I smiled and said, “Thanking **GuShi** for the care, the journey was not bumpy.”

Guo Furen nodded and smiled kindly. After the greeting, she invited the Wei Clan members in the hall to greet me one by one. 

The Wei Clan was from Hexi, and although was considered a high ranking and noble clan, it was not a big clan. Instead of moving all the Clan’s members to Yongdu, Wei Jue only brought a few capable brothers and nephews. All their wives and children stayed together and currently they were all in this room. 

Standing beside Guo Furen was a male and a female of similar age, both were wearing embroidered clothes, with clear brows and eyes, like a pair of children in painting. When Guo Furen called them out, they came to greet me. 

The boy was named Wei An who was twelve years old this year, and he shares the same mother as Wei Tan, both born by Wu Furen. The girl was called Wei Rong, fourteen years of age, and was born by Guo Furen. Wei An called me “**ZhangSao**<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="eldest sister-in-law"></sup>” and quickly withdrew his gaze. Wei Rong however kept looking at me with eyes full of curiosity.

Beside Wei Rong, Guo Furen also gave birth to the Second Young Master, Wei Zhao. During the journey, I heard Zhang **Shi** said that Wei Zhao also followed Wei Jue on the expedition, and now the only children left in the Wei Residence were Wei An, Wei Rong, and two babies that were still in swaddling clothes.
