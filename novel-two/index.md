## Synopsis

The legitimate eldest grandson of the Grand Duke of Jing, Zhao Huanxi, was born into a prestigious family with beauty as lovely as flowers. However, being confined to the inner courtyard, he did not seek advancement, having nothing to his credit except for his good looks.

At the age of sixteen, he married Xu Nian’an, the daughter of the late Wujing Boshi (the teacher of the Imperial Academy).

Xu Nian’an was astute and capable. Soon as she married into a high-status family, she shed all pretense of cordiality with her malicious Aunt.

The malicious Aunt was shamed into anger and spouted a stream of nonsense: “The father-in-law is biased, and the mother-in-law is overbearing. If it weren’t for the delicately good-for-nothing Zhao Huanxi, would you even have had a chance? Do you think marrying into a high-status family is your big stroke of luck? It's nothing but a big joke!”

Xu Nian'an looked at her obedient, charming, and sweet-hearted husband and smiled back, saying, "Well, that's still better than marrying beneath oneself and becoming a laughingstock."

Three years into the marriage, the young husband diligently pursued progress. He excelled in both literary and military skills, capable of serving in the government and fighting on the battlefield. With his handsome appearance, he attracted attention and admiration throughout the capital city, yet he remained devoted to her alone.

The mother-in-law treated her like her own daughter, ensuring that she lacked nothing, including the finest and most luxurious things.

As for the biased father-in-law who favored concubines over his wife and mistreated her, well, my apologies, but he was promptly kicked out by the grandfather, sent flying a hundred thousand miles away.

Others might have thought that Xu Nian'an had stumbled into good luck by marrying so well, but only her mother-in-law, Yin Furen, knew the truth: "Try replacing her with someone else; see if you can achieve the same."
