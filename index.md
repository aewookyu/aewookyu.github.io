Welcome to my translation archive.

I’m a student who loves dabbling in translation as a hobby. I mostly translate novels and stories from Chinese, and I like to stay really close to the original—keeping the flavor, the wording, and all those little cultural nuances intact.

That means sometimes I’ll keep names, titles, and pronouns in pinyin, or stick with phrasing that might feel a bit unusual in English. If that’s not your cup of tea, no worries—you might want to skip these translations. But if you love seeing the original Chinese flavor shine through, you’re in the right place!
