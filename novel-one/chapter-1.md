I sat on the couch, listening to the noise outside. 

The musical instruments played by the entertainers were mixed with the hearty loud laughter of the soldiers. Contrary to the hustle and bustle outside, only separated by the military tent, the atmosphere here seemed so deadly silent. Everything inside the tent was quite simple; a couch, a table, a seat, and a lacquer screen at the back, with a full set of shiny body armor standing beside it. 

Anyone who sees can tell that the owner is ready to break camp (leave the camp) at any time. It was only due to the wedding that the bed has new colorful sheets, a silk carpet is spread on the floor, and the item for _hejin_<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="合卺 (Héjǐn) - to exchange the nuptial cup / go through the marriage ceremony"></sup> is arranged on top of the table. Although this was as simple as possible, it still shows the sincerity put into this wedding.

“After hearing the good news, ***Zhugong*<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="主公(Zhǔgōng) - the Lord. It is a formal and deeply respectful way for a subordinate to address the leader they have sworn loyalty to."></sup>'s numerous subordinates have all shown up to congratulate. **Jiangjun**<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="将军(Jiāngjūn) - general; a formal military title used to address a high-ranking commander or officer."></sup> is unable to leave.” An old woman  with a round face came over and helped me stabilize the pearl hairpin on my temples, and kindly said, “**Furen**<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="夫人(Fūrén) - simply means (married) lady or madam. Usually a respectful title used for the wife of a high-ranking official, nobleman, or leader."></sup> must not be impatient.”

I half-folded the white silk fan in my hand and silently bowed my head. 

The old woman seemed to be satisfied, and ordered the maids to prepare some items for _xishu_<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="洗漱(Xǐshù) - to wash the face and rinse the mouth"></sup> so that it would be easier to serve when the general arrived.

This old woman with the surname Zhang, is said to be my new mother-in-law’s close confidant. She had especially rushed over from Yongdu<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="都(Dōu) means capital, so Yongdu coule also mean the capital Yong"></sup> to manage the wedding of their Lord’s eldest son.

There was nothing to be nervous about since this is not my first time. It was the same honey candle, the same wedding dress and even the boxes of dowry were roughly the same as before. It was my second marriage. The first time, I was married over from Chang'an to Laiyang, and this time, my in-laws married me off to another person. 

After the death of the Late Emperor,  the fight for power spread from the Inner Palace out to the Court, which made the world fall into chaos. Warlords from all over the world competed with each other and after years, Wei Jue from Hexi<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="(Héxī)-literally means West River; the west of the Yellow River (Huang He River)"></sup> emerged victorious. Holding onto the Emperor’s seat<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="(meaning he’s escorting the emperor)"></sup>, he moved the capital to Yongzhou<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="州(Zhōu) means Province, hence it means the Yong Province"></sup>, which boomed his fame and power to the fullest. At the beginning of the year, Wei Jue declared war against Dong Kuang, who controlled seven eastern counties. Dong Kuang repeatedly retreated in defeats, while Wei Jue pursued them victoriously. Last month, Wei Jue surrounded Laiyang, and upon hearing the news, the Governor of Laiyang, Han Tian raised the white flag as a means to surrender without fighting.

When the army troops approached the city wall, panic struck upon the Laiyang City. After Han Tian’s surrender letter was handed out, Wei Jue didn’t respond. However, he sent an “invitation” and set up a banquet in the army camp out of the city, saying that they were both colleagues in the Court in the past and wished to reminisce about the old times.

Han Tian dare not refuse, and tremblingly opened the city gate to attend the banquet. Wei Jue was unexpectedly enthusiastic, with wine and music as company, they engaged in lively conversation. When they were semi-intoxicated, he suddenly laughed and asked Han Tian if it was true that the Late Emperor’s former Chancellor, Fu Shi's, daughter is in the resident of Laiyang?

That one question sobered up Han Tian and he repeatedly made sounds of agreement. On the next day, he had immediately sent Fu Shi’s daughter, Fu jin, into the camp. 

That’s right, I am Han Tian’s daughter-in-law. Oh no, it should be the ex-daughter-in-law.

Wei Jue wanted me here, to marry me off to his eldest son, Wei Tan. 

I was married over to Laiyang when I was fifteen, and now I have reached twenty. For a bride, this age was considered an old age to marry.

That husband, Wei Tan, whom I had never met before and had never heard of him either.
