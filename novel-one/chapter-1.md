I sat on the couch, listening to the noise outside. 

The musical instruments played by the entertainers were mixed with the hearty loud laughter of the soldiers. Contrary to the hustle and bustle outside, only separated by the military tent, the atmosphere here seemed so deadly silent. Everything inside the tent was quite simple; a couch, a table, a seat, and a lacquer screen at the back, with a full set of shiny body armor standing beside it. 

Anyone who sees can tell that the owner is ready to break camp (leave the camp) at any time. It was only due to the wedding that the bed has new colorful sheets, a silk carpet is spread on the floor, and the item for hejin<sup class="footnote-ref" data-footnote="合卺 (Héjǐn) - to exchange the nuptial cup / go through the marriage ceremony">[1]</sup> is arranged on top of the table. Although this was as simple as possible, it still shows the sincerity put into this wedding.
